# Contributing to HACK-B0T

So you've decided to contribute to Hack Bot, wonderful! We're glad to have you! But there are a few standards your going to have to follow if you want to see your changes make it into the real thing. Take a peek at the standards below, and if you do it right, you might make a star out of yourself.

### Code Style

The code style for this project can be seen just by taking a look at a few files, but the important bits of it are as follows:
* `camelCase` for methods, variables, and really anything else that isn't an interface or a class
* `PascalCase` for classes and interfaces
* All methods should be commented using the [JSDoc format](http://usejsdoc.org/), include information about any parameters or warnings in the method
* Since Hack Bot is a typescript project, be sure to define types for variables absolutely whenever possible
* Keep line length less than or equal to 80 characters
* Tab width is 4 spaces
* Overall, just try to keep your code clean and readable to the best of your ability, try to keep any methods or variables named descriptively, and avoid too many layers of indentation

### Submitting a Contribution

The first step to making a contribution to Hack Bot is to fork the repo, you can then create a new branch in the fork and push your change to it. **Be sure to keep changes focused**, it's easier for everyone involved if you keep the number of changes in a pull request to a minimum. While there may be a lot of code in a request, have the overarching goal be one single thing.

Once you have created a request, a team member will take a look and comment on any changes they may want you to make. They may also ask you to explain how/why you did certain things in your code. For the best chance of your pull request getting accepted, do your best to comply with any code change requests made.

While any changes will be considered for Hack Bot, new command requests will be more highly scrutinized, this is to keep bloat commands out of the project. Don't let this discourage you though, if you have an amazing command in mind, don't let your dreams stay dreams.

### Thank you

We appreciate any and all contributions to Hack Bot, and enjoy any help (even if it's as small as taking a look at the contributing guide). So **thank you** for showing interest.
